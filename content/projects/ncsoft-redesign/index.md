This was the first project that I worked on at NCSOFT, and I came onto the project about midway. Someone on the development team referred me, so I easily fit right in on the team. A few parts of the design were still ongoing, but much of the frontend styles were already done. I was responsible for building out the site interactivity and content management. 

The team didn’t have a strong preference for a JS library. They had mostly been writing vanilla JS as needed and had started using jQuery in a few cases. The redesign we were working on was the first modern site design and not cookie-cutter for the company that pushed design boundaries for 2009. At the time, I preferred to use JS libraries because it drastically reduced the amount of code that had to be written to support IE 6, 7, and Firefox. Browsers just weren’t developer-friendly back then. After some discussions and on my recommendation, we decided to use YUI. It was a much better library than jQuery, and by the time it was discontinued, interactive development was moving in an entirely new different direction (modularized w/ build tools). 

They had already decided to use Moveable Type as the CMS, so that’s the system where I built out all the content customization. Moveable Type is written in Perl, so it’s never been trendy, but it does have a static build feature that worked well. The out-of-the-box features supported most content customizations, but I had to create an extension that added a few new field types. Extending Movable Type was all done in Perl, so I have a couple of uncles to thank for introducing me to the language. 

The redesign launch went exceptionally well. What I didn’t know at the time was that there were a lot of corporate and studio executives paying close attention to this project to decide if they were going to move all studio site development to our team. About six months later, the company decided to move the product to Seattle and increased the team to 11 developers. I accepted an offer to relocate to Seattle and got promoted to lead front-end developer.
