Guild Wars was an incredibly popular MMO, so there was a ton of hype around the release of Guild Wars 2. ArenaNet worked with more autonomy than our other studios, so we usually supported them rather than fully managing their properties. 

They had decided to use WordPress for content publishing, and at that time, our servers team was adamant that we only were serving up static files for marketing material. We used Movable Type for marketing sites, but WordPress had a superior editing experience. We decided to create a WordPress plugin that would provide deployment for deploying the site as static content. 

At the time, I wasnâ€™t well versed in the WordPress plugin architecture, but I had a lot of experience in strategies for building static content. The deployment controls were based on an already existing deployment tool, so it was familiar. We predominantly used rsync to deploy changes, and for staging environments, we just used virtual hosts on a single instance. Our production infrastructure had a load balancer with multiple apache instances behind it. We would rotate through them when we would deploy changes, taking each offline while Rsync ran, how times have changed.

Creating the static files took a bit to get right, but I relied on the output of page requests to build the static files. Most of the variations needed for the static creation were handled with either a filter or in the template files.
