Blade and Soul was developed by NCSOFT East and launched in the west about 9 after initially launching in the east. It was another beautiful game with a really rich story. My only complaint with the game has more to do with what free-to-play has done to gameplay in MMO’s. 

When we would launch a game in the west that was developed by NCSOFT East, they would create a product team who would be responsible for the business plan. When it came to the site design they wanted a layout that was a bit a-typical. They didn’t have a ton of content at this time or at least wasn’t releasing it initially so there was a lot of room for creativity. The end result was a fixed position main navigation that hugged the left side of the window with scrollable body content on the right. 

The ESRB had given the game the rating of Teen so this was the first site that I worked on that required an age gate. We used Javascript to display the verification screen on whatever page the user entered on. The user is forced to enter their birthday and then we would just make sure that the user is at least 18 years old. We also maintained a list of submissions with the users IP address so that our due diligence to prevent minors access can be shown.
