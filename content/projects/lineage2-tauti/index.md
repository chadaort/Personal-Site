Lineage 2 Tauti was an expansion pack that came after the game went free-to-play. The desgin was created by our in-house design team that we closely collaborated with. This close relationship really allowed us to streamline the process and reduce follow-up desgin during the development process. This was another micro-site that showed some game data but mostly was for marketing purposes.
