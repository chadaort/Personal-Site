Lineage 2 Tauti was an expansion pack that came after the game went free-to-play. Our in-house design team created the design, and with that, we closely collaborated. This close relationship allowed us to streamline the process and reduce follow-up design during the development process. This was another micro-site that showed some game data but mostly was for marketing purposes.
