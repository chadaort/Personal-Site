Carbine Studios was the studio behind the fantasy MMO game called Wildstar. It was a beautiful game that had a lot of excitement going into the release. I think it was a couple of years before they had originally planned to launch that the market started to quickly shift towards free to play. It definitely shook things up a bit within the company but in the end, they launched as a premium subscription and about a year later, they shifted to free to play.

The site design was a drab brown that they were very adamant on keeping. The design and overall look was very simple and straightforward. We built this out in Moveable Type and used our custom set of CSS utility classes that we shared across projects. I was the lead developer at the time and so I oversaw the project and I also built out the backend for fetching data from our jobs board and displaying on the frontend.
