The game had already been online for 6 years and Going Rogue was the second expansion pack in the City of Heroes universe. The art director for the studio did the site design and did a really good job designing it in a way that could be converted to code. Most of the design adjustments were related to localization and not factoring that into the design. I was excited about the project because new site builds were always fun when you could do them and the design was on point.

I was the sole developer on the project and was under a fairly tight schedule considering the upcoming release date. The site is what you would call a microsite and only had around 12 pages. Content on a site like this is fairly static but there are certainly going to be text changes post-launch and so itâ€™s often better to just build it within a content management system. 

Video game sites often have an intricate design but also need to be vertically flexible to allow for dynamic content and localization. This was before responsive design and when games designed content frames to look like the user interface in the game. There were usually just small design changes that were needed to get the repeatable image patterns that we needed. The project was launched on time and met the visual expectations of the art director.
