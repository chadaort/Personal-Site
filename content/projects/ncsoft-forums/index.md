NCSOFT provided community forums for most all games using Vbulletin. Each game had their own community team that would moderate and engage with players. Community managers are some of the biggest power users and know exactly what tools they want to use. 

For each game we would create a custom theme and either use our own publisher icon set or the studios would provide their own icon set. The plugin space for Vbulletin was very hit or miss on whether they would be on par with our strict security requirements so usually we couldnâ€™t use them out of the box. We had several plugins that we had created to either player expected features or tooling that moderators needed to maintain quality content.

For the first couple of years that I worked at NCSOFT, a single person had done all the forum development. Then one day that person left the company and little was known about the process. For the next several months, I got familiar with the plugin architecture and the theming capabilities. I was responsible for making any changes while I ironed out and documented the development pipeline. In the end we had a way to do local development with dummy data, stage changes for QA, and use already existing tooling for deploying the changes to production.
