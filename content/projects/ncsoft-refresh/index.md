Corporate site changes and especially redesigns can have a really tricky approval process and this project was no different. I think we ended up adding on like a dozen stakeholders in various capacities through the process. The one thing that everyone was in alignment on was that our corporate site needed to focus on the studios rather than on the publisher. What there wasn’t alignment on was how it should look and present the games. Each studio had their own unique opinions and to complicate matters, I managed our relationship with the development in Seoul and they were communicating a lot of feedback through me. In the end, our CEO stepped in and managed all the feedback and effectively made the design decisions.

I managed the project but didn’t do any development work on the project. This was most reskinning the current except for game pages. I’m not sure that everyone was happy with the end result but development completed the project on time.
