As the publisher, NCSOFT, managed all the newsletters for any current and upcoming games. Some games had multiple newsletters with varying frequencies and they all had a heavy design. Newsletter development at that time was messy. Outlook was using Word to render their emails and Yahoo had their own quirks. Things were starting to improve and before I left NCSOFT, margins had gotten strong support so that was nice. Every little bit helps I guess. 

When I started, the company was building newsletters out individually per request. I wasn’t often assigned newsletter development but folks go on vacation and it came up from time to time. It wasn’t something that excited me but it did get me thinking about how the process could be improved. When I took on the lead developer position, I had a pretty good idea about what changes needed to be made. The biggest change was to formalize the process and make it consistent with all other development.
