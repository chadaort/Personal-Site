I worked for Proper Media for about a year and a half and one of the projects that I worked on was a wiki and forum redesign for TV Tropes. TV Tropes is a cool wiki if youâ€™re one of those types of people that take notice of the patterns that exist across the medium or just want to better understand the bits of storytelling. TV Tropes describes a trope as

> A storytelling device or convention, a shortcut for describing situations the storyteller can reasonably assume the audience will recognize. Tropes are the means by which a story is told by anyone who has a story to tell. We collect them, for the fun involved.

I was familiar with the wiki before applying for a job and so I geeked out on it for a day or two beforehand. A couple of my favorite tropes are [Flandarization](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization) and the [Dead Unicorn](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadUnicornTrope). 

I was responsible for the UI design and frontend development. It had been a few years since I had taken on a large design project but they also were not looking to deviate much from the existing user experience. All in all the end result was a nice improvement. I just wish they had also decided to address the issues with the moderation tools and user experience.
