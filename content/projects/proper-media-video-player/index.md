I did a lot of ad development for Proper Media and one of the projects was to develop a video player that supported VAST and VPAID adverts. Ad inventory for videos has been increasing over the years and so ad companies provide publishers with video players to serve video ads. These players will obviously play videos but they also often support RSS feeds where the player turns into a slideshow while still serving video ads.

I had built an HTML5 video player with a Flash fallback at NCSOFT but this time, I decided to use the Video.js framework. There weren't a lot of VAST and VPAID clients at the time and so I spent a decent amount of time building out the parsers for both XML formats. What I probably spent the most time working on was getting videos play in-line across several versions on the iPhone. It was an exciting project to work on because I got to really understand both ad formats.
