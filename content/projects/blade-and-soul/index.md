Blade and Soul was developed by NCSOFT East and launched in the west about nine after initially launching in the east. It was another beautiful game with a vibrant story. My only complaint with the game is about what free-to-play has done to gameplay.\

When we would launch a game in the west that NCSOFT East developed, they would create a product team responsible for the business plan. When it came to the site design, they wanted an a-typical layout. They didn’t have a ton of content at this time or weren’t releasing it initially, so there was a lot of room for creativity. The result was a fixed position site navigation that hugged the left side of the window with scrollable body content on the right. 

The ESRB had given the game the Teen rating, so this was the first site that I worked on that required an age gate. We used Javascript to display the verification screen on whatever page the user entered. The user is forced to enter their birthday, and then we would make sure that the user is at least 18 years old. We also maintained a list of submissions with the user's IP address to show our due diligence to prevent minor access.
