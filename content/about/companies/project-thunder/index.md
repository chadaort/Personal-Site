Project Thunder developed an ecommerce and CRM platform as a single product. There was a big need for this in early 2000. A lot of brands and personalities were creating an online presence and selling merchandise. Project Thunder catered too small to midsize businesses providing services for creating and managing online stores and customers. 

I was brought on to work with clients and help them bring their visions to life. Many of the clients were established brands or personalities that already had some type of style guide and a sense of what they visually wanted out of  an online shop. In most cases, I went into the kickoff meetings well prepared so the client could describe their vision and we were able to jump right into ideation. The deliverables at the end of the design phase were generally just Photoshop files and in rare cases the client would want to iron out the user experience.

Once the design phase was completed we would jump right into development. This was initially challenging because I had not worked in a .NET environment and found the lack of modularity for frontend components frustrating back in the mid 2000â€™s. I was able to find a balance in most cases and overtime I came much better informed around the features and limitations of the framework. I was able to apply this information to the design phase to properly set expectations leaving the implementation phase mostly problem free.
