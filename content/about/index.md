Hello, my name is Chad Ort and I’m currently working for Snopes as the Lead Developer. I’ve done development work for the last 14+ years in multiple industries; gaming, advertising, and media. My recent focus has been WordPress, React, and managing our development work.

I started programming when I was in high school with Pascal and I also worked at a computer repair shop at the time and the owner was a great mentor. Around 2004 I started building websites for friends and family in my spare time and then in 2007, I accepted my first position in development. My focus for the first few years was frontend development and learning to work with a couple of different content management systems. I was lucky that my first job was on a team that enforced a high-level of code quality and taught me to write readable and maintainable code. Over the years, I shifted to doing mostly backend development and managing development teams.

My partner and I enjoy spending time outside and working with animals so in 2016, we bought a tiny house in Tennessee that was under 300 square feet with 20 acres of property. There were already 3 pastures on the property with a pond in one of them and so we got chickens, ducks, and goats. This was a big shift from spending my days working in downtown Seattle but I loved the contrast between spending my days in an office vs my time in nature working with animals.

When the pandemic hit in 2019 the tiny house quickly started feeling way too small. We had a lot of space outside but when you stop going places or visiting friends, the tiny house starts to feel way too small. We ended up buying a new house and we still have our ducks and chickens.
