Hello, my name is Chad Ort, and I’m currently working for Snopes as the Lead Developer. I’ve done development work for the last 14+ years in multiple industries; gaming, advertising, and media. My recent focus has been WordPress, React, and managing our development work.

I started programming in high school with Pascal, and I also worked at a computer repair shop, where the owner was a great mentor. Around 2004 I started building websites for friends and family in my spare time, and then, in 2007, I accepted my first position in development. For the first few years, my focus was frontend development and learning to work with a couple of different content management systems. I was lucky that my first job was on a team that enforced a high level of code quality and taught me to write readable and maintainable code. Over the years, I shifted to mainly doing backend development and managing development teams.

My partner and I enjoy spending time outside and working with animals, so in 2016, we bought a tiny house in Tennessee that was under 300 square feet with 20 acres of property. There were already three pastures on the property with a pond in one of them, so we got chickens, ducks, and goats. This was a significant shift from working in downtown Seattle, but I loved the contrast between spending my days in an office vs. my time in nature working with animals.

When the pandemic hit 2019, the tiny house quickly started feeling too small. We had a lot of space outside, but when you stop going places or visiting friends, the tiny house feels too small. We bought a new home and still have our ducks and chickens.
