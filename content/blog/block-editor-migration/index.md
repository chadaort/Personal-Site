At Snopes, we had still been using the classic editor because we have a ton of content, and of course, there is some legacy code still being maintained, so it’s a fairly big commitment to migrate over to the block editor fully. This was a fairly big project for me to take on myself, so we brought a project manager and developer on for five two-week sprints to work through the project.

- Requirements gathering
- Development planning and data modeling
- Block development
- Editorial documentation and training

Considering this was to do a complete migration from custom field plugins, it was a perfect time to rethink how writers enter data for each of our content types. We met with several folks from the editorial team to better understand their workflow and what the pain points are in the classic editor. After a couple of meetings and going through the story creation process with several writers, we had a solid understanding of what they needed.

One of the beautiful things about the block editor is the visual support that you get out of the box so that the editorial team can break their content into columns along with all of the styles you can apply to elements. Once we did an audit of all our existing data fields and associated those with business needs, we were able to define a list of blocks as project requirements. In our development sprints, we were able to focus on the big-ticket items that had immediate editorial value ensuring that we were working towards an end goal that satisfied all stakeholders.

In the end, the editorial team was happy with the transition and really enjoy working with the new editor.
